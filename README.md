# Thesis GitHub Repository

This repository contains the supplementary code and problem instances used in the research conducted for my thesis on optimizing Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling with Variable Activity Durations (RCPSP-VAD) with metaheuristics. This README provides an overview of the repository's contents.

## Contents

1. **Code**: The `eaplanner` directory contains the Python source code for the implementation of various metaheuristic algorithms and the interpretation of the RCPSP-VAD. The necessary scripts and configuration files for running the experiments are located in `run`. Unit tests for the code are located in `tests`.

2. **Instances**: The `instances` directory holds a collection of problem instances used for experimentation. These instances encompass a range of problem sizes, complexities, and characteristics, providing a dataset for evaluating the metaheuristic algorithms. Instances are organized into subdirectories based on the number of activities in them.

3. **Results**: The `results` directory contains the results obtained from running the experiments with the code.
