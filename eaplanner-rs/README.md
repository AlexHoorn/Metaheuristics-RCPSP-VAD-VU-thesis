# Rust Implementation (Unfinished)

This directory contains an unfinished Rust implementation of the project. While the code is incomplete and not fully functional, it has been published here with the intention of providing a foundation for future development and experimentation.

The decision to include a Rust implementation alongside the main Python project is motivated by the performance advantages offered by compiled languages like Rust. The Rust programming language is renowned for its emphasis on memory safety and high-performance execution, making it a compelling choice for significantly improving the runtime for future experiments.
